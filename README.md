C-Hough-Transform
=================

An open source hough transform implemented by c, and optimized for realtime use on dsp c6400 
Include:
1. Hough Transform for finding circles
2. Hough Transform for finding circle inside circle
3. Hough Transform for finding lines
4. Sobel Filtering 
5. Mean Blur
All of those algorithms above have or will be optimized for real time running on C6437 DSP.
